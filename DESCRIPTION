Description: JASPAR is an open-access database containing manually curated, 
             non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles for 
             TFs across six taxonomic groups. In this 9th release, we expanded 
             the CORE collection with 341 new profiles 
             (148 for plants, 101 for vertebrates, 85 for urochordates, and 
             7 for insects), which corresponds to a 19% expansion over 
             the previous release. To search thisdatabases, please use the 
             package TFBSTools (>= 1.31.2).
